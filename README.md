# Find Me a Water
### Topic: India 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (Clean Water and Sanitation)

**Find Me a Water** is a website that helps users find the availability of water sources in their area and also allows users to add information about water sources that are lacking. The website's primary goal is to provide a centralized platform for people to locate water sources and report any water scarcity they may encounter.
    
## Features:
      
* Map-based Interface: WaterMap will have a map-based interface that allows users to search for water sources and report water scarcity. Users can zoom in and out of the map to locate water sources in different areas.
      
* Add Water Sources: Users can add water sources to the map, including public drinking fountains, wells, taps, and other sources of water. Users can also provide additional information about the water source, such as water quantity and information.
      
* Report Water Scarcity: Users can report water scarcity by adding a marker on the map indicating the location and severity of the problem. This information will be visible to other users and can help raise awareness about the issue.
